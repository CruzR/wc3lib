Major:
* bones
* animations
* textures, uv-mapping
* special effects (I think this only amounts to including the proper texture files that war3 provides for stuff like fire, etc.)
  (Pollux: I actually think this is some real crap like the particle emitter and ribbon emitter blocks in MDX, plus stuff like fire
   should be animations, i.e. sequences)

Minor:
* add descriptions for blocks when dumping
