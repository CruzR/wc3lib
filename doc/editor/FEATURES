List of World Editor's emulation's features and their corresponding descriptions (features which are not available in the original version):

General:
* Selection dependency export: You can export selected items only (in object editor, trigger editor etc.) with or without checking dependencies (e. g. abilities used by unit are exported into a separate file).
* Merging: Object data, trigger data etc. could be merged, you do not have to replace everything.
* Advanced string treatment: Strings of selections only could be imported and exported and are merged with the actual string file of the map.

Advanced:
* Custom tileset can be defined correctly (with limit of 16 different ground and 16 different cliff textures).

Brushes:
* Storable selection grouping ("war3map.wgr" stores groups) which can be hidden etc.
* New action "Select in rect" which allows you to select specific type of objects in rect only.
* When copying selection (Doodads) into another map or to another position, height should be hold correctly (WE bug).
* Detailed height/position options can be specified for Destructibles and Doodads.
* Pathing and detailed height/size/tilepoint settings can be specified for terrain brush.

Trigger Editor:
* Allows access to local variables (parses custom script "local" statements and provides default action to define some).
* Advanced syntax highlighting for custom text triggers (from Kate).
* Action "Convert to GUI trigger" can be used on custom text triggers - Trigger editor tries to reproduce trigger actions.

Import Editor:
* Allows multiple item selection.
* Allows importing/exporting directories.
* Allows importing/exporting archives (MPQ archives as well).
* Shows if file from any source is overwritten by the imported file.
* Allows generic MPQ editor functionality (compression settings etc.).

Object Manager:
* Doodads can be selected via Object Manager in map terrain.

Object Editor:
* Meta data SLKs etc. should have a column with describing tooltip refering to a string id (like name) which is displayed in object editor (see descriptions on mappedia.de for example).
