Consider that wc3lib supports runtime linking/loading by default which means that libraries
will be loaded at runtime and if loading fails an exception will be thrown thrown.
Bear in mind that this is only valid for external format libraries (not core libraries like Boost/Qt/KDE/Ogre).

Flags:
STATIC - Everything will be linked statically with applications if possible (creates big static wc3lib library).
NORUNTIME - Dynamic format libraries (e. g. jpeg library) will be linked during compilation and won't be loaded dynamically at runtime.
EDITOR - Qt/KDE 4 are required!
DOC - Generates doxygen documentation (doxygen is required)

cmake example:
"cmake -DEDITOR=1 -DDOC=1"

DEPRECATED:
Compilation flags for native format conversion support:
BLP:
	- JPEG
	- PNG
	- TGA

MDLX:
	- BLEND
	- MAX

MPQ:
	- TAR
